%% Partial Fourier Imaging

% Zero-Filled Reconstruction: Load Data_Assignment3_Problem1.mat into MATLAB. This
% contains fully-sampled k-space data from a T1-weighted brain scan. The data only has a
% single receiver coil (to keep things simple for now!). 
% Retrospectively undersample this data
% using a partial Fourier factor of 5/8. This is a bit larger than what is often used in practice â€“
% however, this will make it easier to see the artifacts. 
% Assume that the phase encoding
% direction is oriented vertically. Perform a zero-filled reconstruction, and display both the
% magnitude and phase of the image. Next, compute the difference between this image and
% the fully-sampled image, and display the magnitude and phase of the difference image. Note
% that you may need to adjust the windowing level to better visualize the difference image.
